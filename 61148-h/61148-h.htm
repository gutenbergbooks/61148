<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/dcapt.png" width="206" height="200" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE first glimmering of dawn
rested on Waipio Valley.
The <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi kane</i>, his great nobles
and chief officers of
state, his personal attendants,
his guards, heralds,
priests, diviners, bards, story-tellers, dancers,
and buffoons, the whole <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">aialo</i>, even to the
lowest menials of the court, slept the deep
sleep that follows a night of heavy eating
and heavier drinking. All slept except Aa,
the terrible high-priest, and a few score men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>2]</a></span>
of his personal following. The royal city
was silent.</p>

<p>It lay among surroundings both lovely
and grand. The valley itself, only a few
feet above sea-level and flat as a Western
prairie, was, then as now, rich almost beyond
exaggeration, and green with all edible products
of the lowlands. It was thickly dotted
with grass huts, for in those times, before
the great wars and centuries before the
white strangers came with their loathsome
diseases that consumed flesh and bone, the
population was dense.</p>

<p>The valley fronted on the open ocean, unobstructed
by land for thousands of miles.
On every other side it was shut in by rock
walls from two to three thousand feet high.
At the southwest extremity the Waipio River,
cold from the mountain-side, clear and
sparkling, fell six hundred feet to a narrow
shelf of rock, and then, dropping a thousand
feet more at a single plunge, suddenly became
a sluggish stream, with a current hardly
perceptible, winding its tortuous way to
the sea. To the northwest were the Saw-Teeth
of the Gods, wild and picturesque
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>3]</a></span>
verdure-clad mountains that to this day
form impenetrable barriers between the
plantations of Hamakua and North Kohala.
To the southeast, stretching along the coast
for a hundred miles, were the rich highlands
of Hamakua, Hilo and Puna, rising, ever
rising, as they recede from the sea until they
reach the dizzy heights of Mauna Kea, and
of Mauna Loa, where eternal winter wages
intermittent war with rock fires from the
bowels of the earth.</p>

<p>In the gray twilight of that morning, centuries
ago, Eaeakai paddled his fishing-canoe
down the Waipio River and up the coast,
straight to the Saw-Teeth of the Gods. In
the early morning there was good fishing
opposite those stupendous cliffs, and Eaeakai
had taken to himself a buxom <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">wahine</i>, who
could not live on love alone any more than
if she were a <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">haole</i> bride, but had to have
her fish and poi. He was also in daily expectation
of another responsibility. Thus
far there had always been fish and poi in
his hut, for he was industrious and thrifty,
rich for a landless freeman, <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">kanaka-wale</i>, as
his <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">kaukehi</i> or single dug-out was the trimmest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>4]</a></span>
and swiftest on all the Windward
Coast. Best of all, he was a happy man, for
he was very much in love with his own wife.
So he chanted a love <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">mele</i> as he bent to his
work.</p>

<p>He had scarcely reached his fishing-ground
and baited his turtle-shell hook when he heard
a rustling sound overhead. As he looked up
he caught glimpses through the dense foliage
of a woman, in the garb of Eve, rapidly
making her way down the steep declivity,
regardless of the sharp thorns and terrible
lava that cut and tore her hands and feet
and body. Yet, in spite of her desperate
haste, and at the peril of her life, she firmly
clutched and carefully guarded from rock
and thorn the <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">mamo</i> which royalty alone
might wear and live.</p>

<p>Eaeakai gazed for a moment, dumb and
motionless with amazement. Then he flung
himself upon his face, crying, &ldquo;<em lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">E moe o! E
moe o! Hiwa, Moi Wahine!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hiwa gave command before she reached
the bottom of the cliff&mdash;&ldquo;Fisherman, bring
me the boat! <em lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Wiki wiki!</em> Quick!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kneeling in his canoe, Eaeakai paddled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>5]</a></span>
to the shore and prostrated himself with his
face to the ground, for well he knew that
by Hawaiian law it was death for a common
man like him to stand in the presence or in
the shadow of Hiwa, <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">alii-niaupio, tabu moi
wahine</i>, goddess-queen.</p>

<p>She sprang into the canoe, seized the
paddle, and sped up the coast.</p>

<p>Eaeakai lay grovelling on the ground until
she was a goodly distance from him.
Then he sat up and began to realize that
probably he was ruined. His boat, which
made him the envy of fishermen for fifty
miles around, and upon which he had spent
months of patient toil, was gone. It was
his pride, his wealth, his livelihood. Hiwa
was fleeing from enemies. He could expect
no reward if she should escape and return in
triumph, for he was beneath her notice; but,
if she should be overtaken and slain, the
service he had rendered her would not be
forgiven. The boat would tell the story,
and he would be hunted down and killed or
offered a sacrifice to the gods.</p>

<p>Presently, as he turned his eyes in the
direction of his home, he saw a great war
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>6]</a></span>
canoe approaching. He hid behind a rock
and watched it. He counted twenty-six
warriors at the paddles, and recognized Aa,
the high-priest, commanding them. They
had caught sight of Hiwa, and were doing
their utmost to overtake her.</p>

<p>Eaeakai knew that an heir to the throne
was expected. Who in all the land did not?
&ldquo;If it were not for her condition,&rdquo; he said
to himself, &ldquo;she might give them a long
chase; but the end would be the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her enemies rapidly gained on her, although
she handled the paddle with marvelous
strength and skill, and she seemed to
have no chance of escape. Suddenly she
plunged into the water and disappeared.</p>

<p>Her pursuers hastened to the spot. One
of them reached out to save the boat, a
chattel of great value to a Hawaiian; but
the fanatical high-priest interposed. &ldquo;Let
it dash itself to pieces on the rocks!&rdquo; he
exclaimed. &ldquo;It is accursed! <em lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Tabu!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The shore at that point was a traverse
section of one of the huge Saw-Teeth, rising
from deep water nearly perpendicularly two
thousand feet into the air. No living creature,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>7]</a></span>
save some insect or reptile that clings
to the bare face of a rock, could obtain a
foothold there. Hiwa was not a lizard to
cling to that cliff, and if she were, she would
be in plain sight. Neither was she a bird
to soar above and beyond it. She was not
a fish; if still alive, she must come to the
surface. After watching for her long and
anxiously, they discovered a few drops of
blood. A sharp fin above the waves, slowly
moving seaward, afforded a ready explanation.</p>

<p>The high-priest&rsquo;s face lighted with savage
triumph as he cried: &ldquo;Ukanipo, the Shark-God,
hath her! Ku is avenged!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So thought Eaeakai. &ldquo;Black death hangs
over me!&rdquo; he wailed. &ldquo;Lilii will have no
<i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">kane</i> to bring her fish and poi and the little
<i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">keike</i> will be fatherless from its birth!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The story of the death of Hiwa and of
the unborn heir to the throne spread from
lip to lip through the nation, and all men believed
it and said, &ldquo;Ukanipo, the Shark-God,
hath her! Ku is avenged!&rdquo; And a
great fear fell upon them, the fear of Aa,
the terrible high-priest of Ku.</p>

<h2><a name="chap02" id="chap02"></a>CHAPTER II<br />

<span class="chaptitle">THE VOW</span></h2>
</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/dcapa.png" width="197" height="200" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A WOMAN lay on the ground.
She was about twenty years
of age, of regal stature;
for among ancient Hawaiians
men and women of
kingly stock were gigantic,
fully six feet in height, with broad shoulders,
deep, full bust, and huge hips and limbs that
indicated great vitality and enormous
strength. Yet her figure, from the mighty
neck to the delicately shaped feet, was so
graceful in its outlines, so perfect a type of
beauty in a giantess, that it would have
been a joy to Phydias. Her face was full
of intelligence, of firmness, of daring, and of
pride; full also of passion, of tenderness, and
of love. It was both strong and beautiful.
Her head was massive and noble, like her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>9]</a></span>
body, and was crowned with a glory of jet-black
hair reaching to her hips.</p>

<p>There was no clothing, not even an ornament,
on her person. Her soft, delicate,
satiny skin told of luxurious living. Exposure
and pain and hardship were plainly
new to her, and the <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">mamo</i>, which lay beside
her, wet with the brine of the sea, was evidence
that her rank among her people was
like that of the immortal gods. Her hands
and feet and arms and legs and thighs and
body were bleeding, terribly cut and torn.</p>

<p>She endured her wounds and the pangs of
maternity without a groan, her eyes resting
meanwhile on the wall of rock, two thousand
feet high, that encircled her. A rivulet,
flowing from the mountain above, fell over
the stupendous precipice, and the wind,
eddying round and round in the enormous
pit, the crater of an extinct volcano, spread
out the water into a sheet of silvery spray
like a vast bridal veil. The sun was now approaching
meridian, and its rays, falling
upon the spray, formed a brilliant rainbow,
spanning the birth-scene.</p>

<p>As soon as the child was born the mother
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>10]</a></span>
clasped it in her arms and exultantly cried,
&ldquo;He shall sit on the throne of his fathers,
for the rainbow covered him! Thus <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">mois</i>
are born!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she kneeled upon the ground and
stretched forth her arms in prayer&mdash;&ldquo;Eternal
Ku, thou who bearest sway over gods and
<i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">mois</i> as over common men, hear this my
vow! I have sinned, and my life is forfeit;
but the child is sinless, and if I die now he
will perish. Spare me to him till he can
hurl the spears and lead the chiefs in battle
for his throne, and I will offer thee such
priceless sacrifice as never yet was slain before
a god, for I, the goddess-queen, with
my own royal hand will shed my sacred
blood to thee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she ceased a peal of thunder came from
the mountains.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eternal Ku,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;thou hast
heard and answered, and although I die, my
child shall yet be <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi</i>, the mightiest of his
line! His name is Aelani, The Pledge from
Heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="chap03" id="chap03"></a>CHAPTER III<br />

<span class="chaptitle">A ROYAL MARRIAGE</span></h2>
</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/dcaph.png" width="203" height="200" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&ldquo;HIWA,&rdquo; said Papaakahi, The
Mighty, not long before
his death and about two
years prior to the events already
narrated, &ldquo;you have
grown to be a woman. It
is time for you to marry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, father,&rdquo; Hiwa replied, &ldquo;it is time
for me to marry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Traditions have come down to us from
the beginning,&rdquo; continued Papaakahi, &ldquo;that
beyond the great ocean are many and
strange lands, <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">kahiki</i>, and men with white
skins, who are wise and powerful as gods.
There may be a man in these foreign lands
worthy to marry you; but, if there is, he
cannot come to you, neither can you go to
him. Our god, Lono, dwells there, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>12]</a></span>
some time, ages hence perhaps, he will return
and tell us of these things; but now
we know nothing of them. There are only
three men in the world we know about
whose blood is fit to mate with yours. I
am too old to marry you. Your uncle, Aa,
shall not. There is no one else but your
brother, Ii.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, father,&rdquo; pleaded Hiwa, &ldquo;I do not
love Ii.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a small matter,&rdquo; said Papaakahi.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, father, I love Kaanaana, and he
loves me. Why cannot I marry him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is not of the blood of Wakea, and
Papa, my child, he is not descended from
the gods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet he is a mighty <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">konohiki</i>, father, a
great noble, the greatest of your vassals,
and of all the men in the land his blood is
next to our own. Besides, he is young and
handsome and strong, first in the games
and bravest in war, and his spearmen
won the bloody battle that made you The
Mighty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Hiwa, he is all you say, and I love
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>13]</a></span>
him better than I love your drunken brother;
but he is not of the blood of the gods. You
must marry Ii.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, because Papaakahi&rsquo;s word was the
law of the land, which not even Hiwa
could question, and because she loathed
marriage to her brother, and loved Kaanaana
more than her own life, she went away by
herself and wept bitterly. She spent many
days in solitary places, weeping and longing
to die.</p>

<p>Papaakahi cared little for his drunken son
Ii, and loved Hiwa as the apple of his eye,
and when he saw how she grieved, his heart
was heavy; but his purpose remained fixed.
So he went to her and spoke gently and said,
&ldquo;If you marry Kaanaana it will bring civil
war and your death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father, why civil war?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I am old and must soon be hidden
in a cave, and your first-born son would
come before any child of your brother&rsquo;s as
heir to the kingdom. You know our law;
the child takes the rank of its mother, instead
of the rank of its father, for all men
know its mother and no man knows its father.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>14]</a></span>
You yourself take divine rank from your
mother, who was my sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hiwa shuddered, and made no reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your brother,&rdquo; continued Papaakahi,
&ldquo;spends his nights drinking <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">awa</i>, and his
days in sleep. He will rule in name only.
Your uncle will be the real <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi</i>. He hates
Kaanaana, and, if you marry him and have
an heir, he will raise the standard of revolt
as soon as I am dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then let spears settle it!&rdquo; cried Hiwa,
with flashing eyes. &ldquo;I do not fear death,
and I love Kaanaana. I will fight by his
side, and we will slay Aa and his army, for
the spearmen of Kohala will follow where
Kaanaana leads, and he is greatest of the
warriors, and I am daughter of the gods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Ae keike!</em>&rdquo; exclaimed the old man.
&ldquo;But I fear the great high-priest would prevail,
and I will not have my people butchered
and my kingdom destroyed and my daughter
slain. Yet I would reason with you rather
than command. I married my sister because
the ancient custom of our race put
that duty upon me, she being the only
woman of birth equal to mine; but we were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>15]</a></span>
not <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">lolo</i>, fools, to be unhappy about it, for I
loved other women, and she loved other men.
You can be a good girl and marry your
brother without being cold to your lover,
can&rsquo;t you, <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">keike</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Hiwa refused to be comforted.</p>

<p>The next day Papaakahi went to her
again and asked her, &ldquo;My daughter, have
you considered well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hiwa&rsquo;s eyes were hard and dry, as she
answered: &ldquo;I have no choice. Thy word
is as the word of Ku.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is well said!&rdquo; exclaimed the old <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi</i>.
&ldquo;You are a good girl, wise and discreet. Ii
shall be your husband, and Kaanaana your
lover. I have always loved you above all
others, and next to you I love Kaanaana,
and would choose him for your husband if
he were of the blood of the gods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, father,&rdquo; Hiwa cried, &ldquo;if you love
him and love me, let me marry him! I
loathe the custom of our race! I want one
man as both husband and lover! I had
rather be Kaanaana&rsquo;s wife one hour and
then die body and soul than to marry Ii and
be goddess-queen forever!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>16]</a></span>
&ldquo;Hiwa, <em lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">pau</em>! It is not fitting that a
daughter of the gods should marry a man
of mortal blood. It has been done and,
out of my great love for you, I might consent
to it even now if I could not foresee
war and death. Nothing could save you
but Aa&rsquo;s death. The gods, our ancestors,
tell me to kill him. It is my unquestioned
right, for I am <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi</i>, Lord of Life and Death;
yet I cannot kill him&mdash;he is my only
brother. Therefore, and that you may have
a place to hide till he is dead, I will reveal
to you the secret of the hidden crater and
of the passage to it beneath the sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Papaakahi told Hiwa of the crater
in the mountain and how to find the passage
to it, a secret which no other person living
knew.</p>

<p>So Hiwa married Ii, and not many months
afterwards Papaakahi&rsquo;s bones were hidden in
a cave. And so, too, when she fled for her
life, she dived into the sea, and of all who
watched her not one saw her rise again, and
the whole nation believed that Ukanipo, the
Shark-God, had taken her to himself.</p>

<span class="chaptitle">THE RESCUE OF THE BOAT</span></h2>
</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/dcapt.png" width="206" height="200" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Hawaiian Islands, as all
the world knows, are entirely
of volcanic origin.
The soil, whether red or
black, that produces a hundred
tons of sugar-cane and
fourteen tons of sugar to the acre, is lava
pulverized by the suns and rains of thousands
of years. The coffee lands are lava,
rotten, honey-combed, porous, to a degree
still unpulverized, but far on the way to becoming
so. And the recent flows show
what every part of every island has been&mdash;first,
an overflowing sea of boiling rock;
then, when the rock-currents froze, weird,
fantastic, utter desolation. In the mighty
crater of <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Haleakala</i> (The House of the Sun)
are rock-billows as they stiffened unknown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>18]</a></span>
ages ago, rock-billows five hundred feet
high. And smaller volcanoes, once active,
now extinct, are almost numberless.</p>

<p>Hiwa&rsquo;s refuge was the crater of one of
these small, extinct volcanoes. At some
time a lake of boiling rock, perhaps a mile
long and three-quarters of a mile wide and
a thousand feet deep, forcing a subterranean
exit to the sea, had disappeared, leaving a
huge <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">puka</i>, a hole in the mountain, some
two thousand feet deep. As the centuries
came and went the surface rock gradually
became soil of marvellous fertility. Birds,
flying across, dropped seeds of vegetables,
fruits, shrubs, and trees. The place became
a wilderness of luxuriant vegetation. In
moist, eternal summer food for a hundred
mouths ripened every day in the year.
Nor was Hiwa denied her accustomed food
from the sea, as well as from the land.
The <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">makai</i> or sea entrance to the passage
was some three or four fathoms below the
ebb and flow of the tide, but after a few
rods its roof rose abruptly to a height of
several hundred feet, and the passage itself
broadened into a large cavern, its bottom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>19]</a></span>
being a salt-water pool swarming with fish.
And the mountain rivulet, after its wild
leap of two thousand feet, lazily crawled
along the bottom of the crater till it reached
the pool.</p>

<p>So Hiwa and Aelani were safe from hunger
and thirst. Nature provided a varied
and abundant diet. They had no need of
clothes, for the days were not hot nor the
nights cold. They had no enemies to fear.
No other human being knew of their refuge
or dreamed of their existence. There were
no wild beasts to attack them, no poisonous
serpents, no snakes of any kind, no reptiles
or insects that could seriously injure or annoy
them. In that age even mosquitoes
were unknown.</p>

<p>But Hiwa did not look to a safe and easy
existence. She had devoted her life to a
great purpose. She had become more than
a woman, more than a mother. Her son
was Aelani, The Pledge from Heaven. The
rainbow had covered him at his birth, and
Ku had answered her irrevocable vow with
thunder from the mountains. Separated
from her lover, exiled from the human race,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>20]</a></span>
consecrated to death on the altar of Ku, yet
still <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi wahine</i>, believing herself goddess-born,
and as far above mere mortals as we
think ourselves above the brutes, her sole
remaining object in life was to care for her
child, to teach him the accomplishments,
duties and prerogatives of a <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi</i>, to prepare
the way for his return to his people, and then
send him forth to battle for his throne.</p>

<p>Her first task was to secure the fisherman&rsquo;s
boat.</p>

<p>It is said that a native woman on Kahlooawe
kept appointments with her lover on
Lanai, swimming to meet him one night and
returning the next, the round trip being
nearly six miles. Such stories are accepted
without hesitation by people familiar with a
race which still spends much of its time in
the sea, and was practically amphibious until
civilization changed its habits.</p>

<p>Although in swimming and diving Hiwa
had proved herself a match for Kaanaana,
the champion athlete of the nation, she knew
she was undertaking a task dangerous even
for her, if not impossible. Yet she felt that
the boat was worth risking everything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>21]</a></span>
At break of the day following the birth of
her child, having nursed him and tenderly
laid him on a soft bed of ferns, in the shade
of a big <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">koa</i> tree, she swam forth, armed
with a sharp stick to protect herself from
sharks. Sharks, however, were a matter of
small concern; the danger lay in the fierce
waves and terrible cliff.</p>

<p>She crossed the pool, dived through the
<i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">makai</i> entrance, and struck boldly out to reconnoitre.
The boat, as she anticipated, had
been left, a thing accursed, to drift where it
would. She found it, together with the
paddles, a couple of miles to leaward, wedged
between two rocks. It was uninjured, but
dangerously near frequented fishing-grounds,
and there was no time to lose. After an
hour of hard work she got it loose and
paddled swiftly to windward. It was necessary
to load it with small rocks, to make it
nearer the specific gravity of water, so that
it could be floated or sunk at will; but no
stones could be had for half a mile on either
side of the entrance to the crater. The
bare, perpendicular cliff, rising from deep
water, made it impossible to get them at a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>22]</a></span>
nearer point, and, when she had gotten them,
the weight and unwieldy bulk of her prize
made progress exceedingly slow and difficult.
She struggled on for hours.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My child,&rdquo; she muttered, &ldquo;will need this
boat before he can be <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi</i>; and <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi</i> he shall
be, for what the Ruler of the Gods promises
never fails!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A huge shark attacked her. As he turned
to bite she jabbed the stick into his eye, and he
disappeared, leaving blood behind. It was a
moment of extreme peril to her undertaking,
for the incident, trifling as it was, came near
causing her to lose the ballast from the boat.</p>

<p>At length she neared the entrance to
the crater. The supreme test of fortune,
courage, skill, and endurance, was at hand,
for the waves pounded against the cliff with
tremendous power, and the boat had to be
sunk some four fathoms and steered through
a narrow passage of jagged rocks, where the
water sucked back and forth with frightful
velocity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is impossible for a mortal,&rdquo; Hiwa repeated
to herself, &ldquo;but I am daughter of the
gods&mdash;and it must be done!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>23]</a></span>
For some time she lay quietly on her back,
just outside the surf-line, recovering her
strength and watching for her opportunity.
When it came she sank to a depth of about
twenty-five feet, taking the boat with her.
Then the wave struck her and bore her
towards the cliff with resistless power. She
had to keep the boat right side up or the
ballast would be lost. She had to guide it
to the entrance, straight as a spear to a
warrior&rsquo;s heart, or it would be dashed to
pieces. She had to make the entrance herself
or be hurled against the rock, mangled
out of human shape. The passage was small,
and certain death awaited her a single yard
above or below or to the right or to the left.</p>

<p>Strength, skill, and fortune favored her,
or, as she would have said, the will of almighty
Ku. After two minutes of life and
death struggle she entered the passage with
her prize, escaping destruction by a hair&rsquo;s-breadth.</p>

<p>Then the wave receded, the waters pent
up within poured back, and Hiwa felt herself
being irresistibly sucked to the open
sea. With the quickness of thought she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>24]</a></span>
took a turn of the rope around a projecting
rock, and thus hung on until the out-going
current had nearly spent its force.</p>

<p>But already she had been four minutes
under water. The strain of intense action,
the excitement of extreme peril, and the
torture of long-suspended respiration passed
away. The horrible, sickening green and
white of the mad flood in which she was
perishing became cultivated lowlands, rich
fields, beautiful meadows, and waving forests
before her eyes, and the wild surge and roar
seemed the loved voice of Kaanaana, in
whose arms she was falling asleep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; she said to herself, longingly, &ldquo;is
the peace the gods send to their children!&rdquo;
Then the thought returned to her, &ldquo;If I die
the child will die also!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even as Death seized her, her unconquerable
spirit flashed forth, and she tore herself
from his grasp. Abandoning the boat for
the moment, she made her way through the
passage to the surface of the pool.</p>

<p>As her lungs filled with air, the sweet
delirium of a water death vanished, and her
whole body was racked with pain. But it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>25]</a></span>
was no time to heed that, and, diving again,
she caught the incoming flood and saved the
boat. Then, staggering to the tree where
her baby lay half famished, she gave it her
breast and fainted.</p>

<p>Sleep followed the swoon, the long, deep
sleep of utter exhaustion, and then, after
many hours of death-like unconsciousness,
came dreams. She dreamed that Kaanaana,
lying beside her, with his arms twined
around her, told her, between hot kisses, that
Ii and Aa were dead, and that he, being of the
next noblest blood, could now marry her.</p>

<p>As she uttered a cry of rapture, the dream
changed. She saw her child and her lover
dead at her feet, and her fierce uncle stood
before her with a bloody spear in his hand.</p>

<p>The swiftly succeeding events of the past
two days came back to her in visions more
horrible than the reality: her sin against
Ku, the doom hanging over her, the flight,
the pursuit, the escape, the maternity, the
irrevocable vow, and the rescue of the boat&mdash;all
these facts, colored and intensified by
the ghastly fancies that come to us only in
dreams.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>26]</a></span>
She awoke with a shiver. Her head
throbbed. Every bone in her body ached.
Every nerve was pain. Yet, for the moment,
superstitious terror and the reaction of a
noble but over-taxed spirit were far harder
to bear.</p>

<p>Baby fingers and a plaintive wail of hunger
aroused her, and, when the little <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">keike</i> was
again fed and sleeping, she arose and went
to the boat, a few steps away, to satisfy her
bewildered senses that the day&rsquo;s work was
not a dream.</p>

<p>It rested upon the beach of smooth, hard,
white sand, the gift of the coral insect, a
rare one, too, on the rock-bound, windward
coast of Hawaii. Tiny waves murmured on
the shore as softly as a mother&rsquo;s lullaby.
The thunder of the ocean was muffled by a
wall of eternal rock, and the mad rush and
swirl of waters in the passage sounded but
faintly from the furthermost recess of the
cavern. Save for these distant sounds and
the occasional splash of a fish, the silence
of death reigned. All around were black
walls, two thousand feet high, and overhead
shone the moon and the stars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>27]</a></span>
The beauty and grandeur of the solitude
appealed strongly to Hiwa, child of an impressionable
and poetic race, and restored
her to her wonted frame of mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eternal Ku,&rdquo; she cried, falling on her
knees, &ldquo;Ruler of Gods, from whom I am
descended, and to whom I shall return, I
have rescued this boat through thy help. In
it my child shall learn to do such deeds as I
have done this day. In it, when he is grown,
he shall go to meet the chiefs who will follow
him to victory. I thank thee, Ku, and, when
the time comes, I will pay thee with my
blood according to my vow, knowing that
my son is Aelani, The Pledge from Heaven,
and that he shall yet be <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi</i>, mightiest of
his line!&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="chap05" id="chap05"></a>CHAPTER V<br />

<span class="chaptitle">TRAINING A WARRIOR</span></h2>
</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/dcapi.png" width="202" height="200" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was well for Hiwa and
Aelani that a generous soil
and a soft climate gave
them food and warmth.
The separation from her
lover, the hardships of the
escape, the lacerations inflicted by sharp
lava and thorny jungles, the ordeal of
motherhood, the rescuing of the boat, the
grief and suffering, the bodily exhaustion
and mental strain, concentrated in forty-eight
hours, which Hiwa had undergone,
would have killed any ordinary woman.
And Hiwa, of iron constitution as she was,
escaped a lingering death from fever, fatigue,
and wounds almost as narrowly as a sudden
one from violence. For many days she lay
tossing on her bed of ferns, sore from head
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>29]</a></span>
to foot, bruised and strained and torn, aching
in all her bones, parched with thirst, at
times wildly delirious. Yet, in her lucid
moments, she managed to nurse her babe,
and to pick wild fruits sufficient to keep
herself from absolute starvation. For her
child&rsquo;s sake she fought hard for life and won.
Health and strength returned to her.</p>

<p>Then began an existence much like Robinson
Crusoe&rsquo;s on his desert island, but without
clothes, tools, or weapons. It was unlike
Crusoe&rsquo;s also, in that it was cheered by
mother-love, and inspired by a great purpose.</p>

<p>Although Hiwa had been served from infancy
by chiefs and chiefesses, she now did
a slave&rsquo;s work with willing hands. She
gathered grasses and made a hut&mdash;ample
shelter from the rains. She plaited <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">tapa</i>
and wrapped the royal <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">mamo</i> in it, and
covered and sealed it with a coating of gums,
and over all with a coating of coral sand,
so that moths could not get at it or bees
bore it or mice gnaw it, and she layed it
away in a secret place. She also plaited <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">tapa</i>
mats for beds and coverlets, and <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">tapa</i> garments
for herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>30]</a></span>
Among the first things she did, she chose
a hiding-place in the cavern for the boat,
and plaited a great quantity of matting, and
collected a great quantity of gums, and
covered the boat and sealed it up, as she
had sealed up the <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">mamo</i>, that it might be
perfectly preserved until Aelani should have
need of it. The sealing of the boat was the
work of three months.</p>

<p>Fire was a prime necessity. She had
great difficulty in getting it, although she
was acquainted with the only method known
to her people, and had seen the thing done
many times. Rapidly and with all her
strength she rubbed a pointed stick in a
groove, made in another stick of the <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">hau</i>
tree, until at last the fine combustible powder
in the end of the groove ignited. Then she
fanned it to a flame, feeding it with dry
leaves and little pieces of wood. During all
her stay in the crater she never once allowed
it to go out.</p>

<p>She made fish-hooks from shells, filing
them down with a sharp stone, and braided
lines and nets from the fibre of the <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">olona</i>.
A few minutes&rsquo; work each morning supplied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>31]</a></span>
her with fishes for the day. Sometimes
she cooked them in <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">ti</i> leaves, but more frequently
ate them raw, as the most refined
people in the Hawaiian Islands do to this
day&mdash;people of pure white as well as native
blood. Some varieties of fish are considered
great delicacies raw. The <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">malihini</i> (newcomer)
marvels to see ladies and gentlemen
who would grace any society in Europe or
America eating fish raw; but he eats oysters
raw.</p>

<p>Fish and <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">poi</i> are the Hawaiian staff of life.
<i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Poi</i> is made from <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">taro</i>, one of the most digestible
and nutritious of vegetables. Fortunately
for the exiles, <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">taro</i> grew abundantly
along the swampy borders of the stream.
Hiwa baked it under ground, on hot rocks,
and mashed it with a stone, and kneaded and
pounded it until it became a soft dough, and
mixed it with water and left it to ferment.
Then it was <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">poi</i>, which little Aelani learned
to eat almost as soon as his mother&rsquo;s milk.
In that barbarous age, as now, making <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">poi</i>
was considered too severe work for women,
even for female slaves, and no chief had
condescended to it; yet the goddess-queen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>32]</a></span>
bent her back to the task, meanwhile chanting
to her child ancient <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">meles</i> that commemorated
the glories of his ancestors for forty
generations.</p>

<p>They were by no means confined to fish
and <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">poi</i>. Baked bread-fruit, pounded up and
mixed with milk of cocoanuts and juice of
sugar-cane and berries, made a luscious dish
closely approaching a civilized pudding. Any
quantity of fruit was to be had for the picking,
and Hiwa often succeeded in snaring
wild geese, rich and fat from their diet of
berries, and ducks that visited the pool.</p>

<p>Before Aelani was six months old he added
to his diet of mother&rsquo;s milk and <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">poi</i> large
yellow <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">ohias</i> and delicious berries, the <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">ohelo</i>,
the <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">poha</i>, and the <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">akala</i>, sweetened with
juice of sugar-cane. At the end of his first
year he toddled down to the beach and
swallowed the tiny fishes his mother gave
him, their tails wiggling as they disappeared.
At the end of his third year he swam like a
fish himself, and felt as much at home in the
water as out of it. And so, never seeing a
human form or hearing a human voice save
his mother&rsquo;s and his own, he grew to be a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>33]</a></span>
strong, supple, active boy, of brave spirit
and of thoughtful, inquiring mind.</p>

<p>In time there was a work-shop under the
shade of the great <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">koa</i> tree, and tools&mdash;shells
of all sizes and shapes, sharp stones that
served for knives, and rough stones that
served for saws and files&mdash;and coral sand for
polishing. Sticks and pieces of wood, heavy
and hard like iron, were selected with anxious
care, and were cut and fashioned with
infinite labor. Hiwa worked patiently with
the tools Nature gave her week after week,
and at length that task was finished&mdash;the
complete arms of a warrior of sizes adapted
to a boy&mdash;a sling woven from his mother&rsquo;s
hair, long spears, <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">pololu</i>, short spears, <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">ihe</i>, a
war-club, <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">newa</i>, and a feather helmet, but
not of the <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">mamo</i>, the <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">oo</i>, or the <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">iiwi</i>, for
these were unattainable. There were also
blunted darts, and circular, highly-polished
disks of stone, swelling with a slight convexity
from the edge to the centre, such as
warriors used in athletic games.</p>

<p>Then a training, already begun, was patiently
continued month after month and
year after year. For two hours or more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>34]</a></span>
each day mother and son bowled the disks
and fought sham battles. The teacher
was intelligent and exacting. The pupil
was apt. He was scarcely more than half
grown when he could bring down a flying
bird with his sling, and, while running at
full speed, could hurl spear after spear at a
hair&rsquo;s-breadth and not miss. He could
catch spears faster than they could be thrown
at him; he could parry them; he could
avoid them, twisting his body like a flash of
lightning. He could hurl the disks farther
and straighter, run faster, leap higher, and
stay under water longer than Hiwa, although
in training him she had equally trained herself.
She had been familiar with such things
from childhood, and knew that in these warlike
feats her boy already excelled all men
except Kaanaana. He was also immensely
strong for his years, and gave promise of
gigantic stature.</p>

<p>He fought his first battle when he was
eleven. He was sitting, as he had been
taught to do, on a rock at the bottom of the
pool spearing fish, when his mother dived
down and hastily beckoned him to the surface.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>35]</a></span>
&ldquo;It is a shark,&rdquo; she said as soon as their
heads were above water. &ldquo;I am going to
kill him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A man-eating monster eighteen feet long
was swimming leisurely about, carrying
terror to smaller fishes that had thus far
found the pool a safe refuge from sharks,
and had accordingly congregated in large
numbers. It was the first fish larger than
an <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">ulua</i> that Aelani had ever seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me kill him!&rdquo; he eagerly cried,
catching hold of the stick, sharpened at both
ends, which Hiwa held in her hands.</p>

<p>For a moment, as it seemed to Hiwa, her
heart stopped beating. The boy was a mere
child, and, if he should become frightened
and lose his wits at the critical instant, he
would surely be bitten in twain. But there
was no sign of fear in his face. His eyes
shone, and his pulses throbbed with the joy
of coming battle. Why should not he do
it? He was a fish himself almost, with
human intelligence. He knew the trick
perfectly, for in the training, in which nothing
a warrior should know was forgotten, he
had been exercised in it many times, his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>36]</a></span>
mother personating the shark. Even baseborn
men faced sharks without fear, and
Aelani, though but a child, was <em>Aelani</em>, The
Pledge from Heaven.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is born to great deeds,&rdquo; reflected
Hiwa, &ldquo;and must learn to do them. And
there is no danger, for only the God of
Sharks can swim before a child of Wakea
and Papa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, she armed herself with a
spear and kept near him.</p>

<p>The boy swam quietly out to within a
few fathoms of the shark, and then lay upon
the water, almost motionless. The great
fish, thinking he had an easy prey, approached
slowly and turned to bite. As he
did so a small hand, quick as lightning,
thrust the stick between his jaws, and they
closed over it, burying one sharp end in the
roof of the mouth and the other through the
great tongue into the lower jaw. The next
instant, with the supple swiftness of an <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">ulua</i>,
the child dived and glided away. His work
was finished. He had only to keep beyond
reach of the mighty tail threshing the water
in death agony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>37]</a></span>
The teeth were laid carefully aside for the
war-club of man&rsquo;s estate, and the bones were
preserved for fish-hooks and other domestic
uses. Soon, however, there was a glut of
sharks&rsquo; teeth and bones, for the flesh, being
cast into the pool, attracted other sharks,
and these, slaughtered in turn, lured still
others to a cannibal repast and a sudden
demise. The pool swarmed with sharks,
and furnished Aelani great sport. Of course,
other fish became less plentiful. Yet there
were enough.</p>

<span class="chaptitle">HIWA&rsquo;S VISIT</span></h2>
</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/dcapa.png" width="197" height="200" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A GREAT longing came upon
Hiwa to see her lover once
more, and to learn what was
taking place in the kingdom.
The royal city was
only eight miles away, and
a swim of that distance and back again was
no great feat. Neither, as she thought,
would such a visit be attended with much
danger.</p>

<p>So one evening, leaving Aelani asleep, she
armed herself with a short spear and swam
up the coast to the Waipio River. She
chanced to land close to a fisherman&rsquo;s hut.
The night was warm, there being no breeze
from the sea, and the fisherman and his wife
and their girl baby were sleeping on a mat
outside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>39]</a></span>
The fisherman was Eaeakai, whose boat
Hiwa had taken. His testimony as an eye
witness to her death had turned aside Aa&rsquo;s
wrath and saved his life. It did not occur
to Hiwa that she had wronged him in taking
his boat. Neither had he so regarded it.
It simply was his fate. No more do we
think that we wrong bees when we take
their honey, or beasts when we take their
skins. We look upon them as creatures
quite different from ourselves, and existing
merely for our own needs and pleasures.</p>

<p>Hiwa glanced at the fisherman and at the
woman and child sleeping beside him. The
appearance of the latter arrested her attention.
The child was about the age and size
of Aelani, and her features were strikingly
like his and very beautiful. As Hiwa looked
at the mother she saw that she bore an equally
close resemblance to herself. The family
likeness was plain as day, the blood of Wakea
and Papa through forty generations. Hiwa
had heard of a fisher-girl of marvellous
beauty, but had never before deigned to
notice her. This, then, must be that girl; for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>40]</a></span>
no other woman in all the land could be
compared with Hiwa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beyond a doubt,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;this
is my half-sister! Papaakahi, The Mighty,
had many loves. So had my mother; but,
if this woman were my mother&rsquo;s child, she
could not be a fisherman&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Hiwa, believing that the fisherman&rsquo;s
wife was what her lowly condition indicated,
a king&rsquo;s daughter but not a queen&rsquo;s, dismissed
the matter from her mind as of no consequence,
and passed on to the palace of Ii. It
was not a single building, but, like the establishments
of wealthy Hawaiians even to
this day, a little village. The principal house
or hall was raised on a stone embankment, a
wooden framework thatched with grass.
Around it were many smaller buildings, used
for eating and sleeping purposes and storehouses
and for servants, the whole being
enclosed by a stone wall. Men in all stages
of intoxication were around the palace.
Sounds of drunken revelry came from within.
Shouts and snatches of song told the
story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; mused Hiwa, &ldquo;as Papaakahi said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>41]</a></span>
it would be. Ii worships only <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">awa</i>, and Aa
rules the land. One squanders the wealth
of the kingdom, and the other is grasping
and cruel. The time may come, perhaps
too soon, when the chiefs will be ready to
fight against them both.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On this occasion the retainers of the court
were too drunk to take note of passers-by,
and they had become so habitually turbulent
and lawless that honest people avoided that
part of the town after nightfall. Hiwa,
therefore, had no difficulty in making her
way undiscovered to a distant camp. When
she reached it, further progress was quite
another matter, for, although peace reigned
throughout the land, a considerable body of
men slept on their arms, guarded by vigilant
sentinels. But, under cover of the night, and
taking advantage of every hummock and
shrub, Hiwa noiselessly crawled to the entrance
of the great grass house of the chief.
She found it guarded by a man who had
often admitted her in times past&mdash;a warrior,
brave, trusty, and silent.</p>

<p>Emerging from the darkness, she stood
before him with uplifted hand. Instantly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>42]</a></span>
he dropped prone on the ground with his
face in the dust.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Laamaikahiki,&rdquo; she said, in low, soft,
solemn tones, &ldquo;I am the Spirit of Hiwa,
whom Ukanipo, the Shark God, took to himself.
I have come from the other world to
bless your master. Retire twenty fathoms.&rdquo;
Laamaikahiki, without a word or a sign,
with his face still in the dust, wriggled
backwards like a huge worm. Hiwa entered
the house.</p>

<p>Kaanaana lay sleeping on a mat, his sling,
spears, and war-club beside him. Hiwa stood
motionless for some moments, gazing upon
him. Of the two master passions of her life
she herself could not have told which was
the stronger: love for the man sleeping before
her eyes, or for her child sleeping in the
hollow of the mountain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;how I long to
feel his arms about me and his kisses on my
lips! Death with him is sweeter than life
without him. He is my life. If I make myself
known to him, he will leave all and follow
me to the mountain, or muster his vassals
and hurl that drunkard from the throne. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>43]</a></span>
might have been! But now it cannot be,
for my sin would bring the heavy wrath of
Ku upon him. I am a thing accursed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She bent over him and lightly touched his
forehead with her lips. He stirred, opened
his eyes, for an instant looked wonderingly
at her, and then, with a cry of joy, sprang
up to clasp her in his arms.</p>

<p>The self-sacrifice of love held her to her
purpose. Moving backward, she restrained
him with a gesture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am only Hiwa&rsquo;s spirit,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You
cannot touch me. Do not try. Yet I love
you with all my being, as I loved you when I
was flesh and blood. I am permitted to
come to you this once from the other world
to bless you. May Ku&rsquo;s eternal blessings
rest upon you, my own, my only love!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she vanished into the darkness.</p>

<p>The next morning Aelani awoke in his
mother&rsquo;s arms, and his little body was wet
with her tears.</p>

  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/dcapf.png" width="201" height="200" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FEW queens on thrones or in
exile&mdash;indeed, few merely
rich women can command
such leisure as Hiwa might
have had. She had no social
functions, no social
duties. Even the question of dress scarcely
presented itself. Occasionally, on wet
days, she put on a <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">pau</i> of <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">tapa</i>, and Aelani,
when he grew to be a large boy, often wore
a <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">malo</i>, or girdle, around his loins, and sometimes
a <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">kihei</i>, or mantle, over his shoulders.
Frequently, however, mother and child were
arrayed more sumptuously than Solomon in
all his glory, for, after the charming custom
of their race, they made wreaths of fragrant
dark-green <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">maile</i> and many-colored wild
flowers, and decked each other from head to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>45]</a></span>
foot. But this was recreation, not work.
The physical comforts of existence were at
hand for the taking, and Hiwa might have
spent her days, as many of her people do,
lazily floating in the water or lounging in
the shade.</p>

<p>On the contrary, she was never idle. She
felt that the few years given her to prepare
her son for his future work and station
should be improved to the utmost, for, as
soon as he were grown, she could be no
more with him, but must pass from the
altar of Ku to the gods from whom she
came. She believed that a great <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi</i> should
be a god among men by his attainments and
qualities of mind, as well as by birth, and
she was well qualified to instruct Aelani in
all the learning and accomplishments of her
age and nation, for there was no seclusion of
women among Hawaiians, and she had seen
and heard much both at court and in camp.</p>

<p>She taught him the national dances, <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">hula-hula</i>.
They were extremely graceful, expressing
all emotions and passions. Some
were noble; some, according to our standards,
were vile. She taught him the sports
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>46]</a></span>
and the games of chance and skill, at which
it was customary to play for high stakes.
She taught him to sing and to play the
<i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">ukeke</i>, a rude guitar, which she made from
bamboo and <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">olona</i>.</p>

<p>She spent much time in teaching him the
ancient <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">meles</i>, the unwritten literature of the
nation, its epic and romantic poems and love
songs, perpetuated from generation to generation
by men set apart for that purpose, for
in her father&rsquo;s reign&mdash;before a drunkard
came to the throne&mdash;they were always chanted
at feasts and at human sacrifices, and
when the bones of great chiefs were hidden
in caves, and she had learned them by
heart.</p>

<p>Most carefully she taught him the etiquette
of court, camp, and <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">heiau</i>, the observance due
a <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi</i>, who might stand in his presence, who
should remain kneeling, and who must lie
prostrate with their faces in the dust. At the
same time she strongly impressed upon him
the firmness, self-control, dignity, and condescension
which should grace a god among
men.</p>

<p>She told him of the high chiefs and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>47]</a></span>
chiefesses, the great landed nobility who held
their possessions of the <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi</i>, and of the lesser
chiefs who held of the great ones, substantially
according to the Feudal System of
Western Europe in the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>As he grew old enough to understand
something of the work that was set for him
to do, she talked much about the great men
of the kingdom, of their power, resources,
traits and peculiarities, and of how he might
most surely win them to himself. She knew
them well, for it had been the wise policy of
her father to keep them most of the time at
court under his own watchful eyes. More
than of any one else she talked about Kaanaana.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is Lord of Kohala, and a mighty
chief,&rdquo; she often said, &ldquo;the greatest, noblest,
bravest, and best in the land. He is your
father, and I love him even as I love you,
<i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">keike</i>, and he loves me. When the time
comes you will give him a token from me.
Then he will proclaim you <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi</i>, and Ku will
protect you both in the day of battle and
give you the victory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She told him of the gods. &ldquo;There are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>48]</a></span>
three great gods,&rdquo; she said&mdash;&ldquo;Kane, Ku, and
Lono. Kane is greatest of the gods, the
almighty father and creator of heaven and
earth; but he sleeps through the ages, and
gives no heed to what is done among gods
and men, and, therefore, they do not heed
him. Lono is so gentle and kind that men
are not afraid of him, and so they forget
him. Ku is active, masterful, fierce, and
cruel, and delights in wars and human sacrifices,
and bends all things to his will, and
rules alike among gods and men; so we
worship Ku. Wakea, our ancestor, is a
great god, and, next to Ku, bears sway over
heaven and earth; and the <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">mois</i> of his blood,
whose bones have been hidden in caves,
from the beginning down to Papaakahi,
The Mighty, are also great gods. There are
lesser gods&mdash;Kanaloa, Kane&rsquo;s younger brother;
Milu, God of the Lower World; Pele, the
red-haired Goddess of Volcanoes; Kanehoalani,
God of the Sky; Kanehulikoa, God
of the Sea; Kukailimoke, God of War; Mokuhalii&mdash;whom
we call Ukanipo&mdash;God of
Sharks, and many others; and <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">kupuas</i>, or
demi-gods, and <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">kini akua</i>, or elves. <em lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Ae
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>49]</a></span>
keike!</em> There are many gods, but there is
no other god like Lono!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me about him!&rdquo; exclaimed Aelani.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He came to us from heaven,&rdquo; said Hiwa,
&ldquo;many, many generations ago, in the form
and likeness of a man, and he lived on earth,
and his mission was love. He hated tears
and wars and human sacrifices. He told
men and women to be kind to each other as
they would have others kind to them. He
taught the people many things which would
have made them wise and happy if they had
remembered and practised them; but they
forgot his good words after he was gone, for
he went away beyond the great oceans. He
will come back to us some time, but not
now, and meantime Ku rules gods and men
by fear alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Year after year, as they lay at noon under
the shade of the great <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">koa</i> tree, or at
night under the moon and the stars, Hiwa
talked with Aelani about the rites and ceremonies
of the priesthood, and the arts of
<i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">kahunas</i>, and the traditions of her people,
about their customs and ways of living,
about the birds and beasts and fishes, about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>50]</a></span>
the country she had seen, and the mountains
and streams and ocean. Everything she
knew that she thought might be useful to
him when he should go out into the world
she told him again and again, until all these
things became fixed in his mind. She told
him the story of her life and her love. But
she said nothing to him of her sin against
Ku, or of the time, so close at hand, when
she must shed her own blood on Ku&rsquo;s altar.</p>

<p>She also told him much about women, and
he often wondered if they were very different
from his mother, for he imagined that,
as she alone of all living women was goddess-born,
she must be more beautiful than
any other. As he grew older, without
knowing why it was so, he yearned to meet
a woman.</p>

<span class="chaptitle">MANOA</span></h2>
</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/dcaph.png" width="203" height="200" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">HIWA repeated her visits to
Waipio many times as the
years went by. In her
anxiety to know the condition
of affairs she frequently
ventured where she
was likely to be seen and recognized. She
knew that she had been recognized on several
occasions. By day it might have cost
her her life; but, appearing only at night,
when spirits were supposed to be abroad,
she was regarded, not as Hiwa in living
flesh and blood, but as the spirit of Hiwa
that Ukanipo had taken to himself. She
justly trusted to the superstition of the people
for safety, knowing that she had become
an object of mortal terror.</p>

<p>Sixteen years had passed since her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>52]</a></span>
escape. Ii was rapidly nearing a drunkard&rsquo;s
grave, or, more accurately, the time when
his bones would be hidden in a cave, for
<i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">mois</i> were not buried in the ground like
common men. Aa had become <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi</i> in all
but name, and ruled with bloody and cruel
hands. The masses groaned under his ruthless
exactions. Many of the lesser chiefs
had been assassinated or sacrificed on the
altars of Ku, and their possessions confiscated.
The great chiefs were becoming
restive and alarmed. Yet who should take
up arms against the Lord of Life and Death,
vice-gerent of Ku? Ii and Aa were of the
blood of the gods. Hiwa knew how matters
stood, and believed the time for action
would come soon if the great nobles understood
they could have a leader of divine
birth.</p>

<p>Aelani had not reached his seventeenth
year&mdash;a mere smooth-water swimmer. The
pool, swarming with sharks, was a fine training
school for a boy of twelve; but the
ocean was the only proper place for an
athletic young man, big, powerful, destined
for great deeds. Aelani had learned to love
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>53]</a></span>
it in its varying moods, and most of all
when it was stirred to wrath, when tempests
raged and huge waves dashed against the
cliffs and broke in spray two hundred feet
high. Many a time, in calm and in storm,
Hiwa and Aelani had sported together in
the open sea, like the fish to which they
were almost akin, but always with the
greatest precautions against discovery, for
the superstition which protected her might
not protect him. Now the time was at
hand when risks must be taken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Keike</i>,&rdquo; said Hiwa, one evening, &ldquo;we
will go windward to-night and see your
royal city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They emerged from the water, at their
journey&rsquo;s end, close to Eaeakai&rsquo;s hut. On
this night also the fisherman and Lilii, his
wife, and Manoa, their daughter, were sleeping
outside. The girl&mdash;just past sixteen,
which is three years older in the tropics
than in the frozen north&mdash;was surpassingly
beautiful, as her mother and Hiwa had been
in the bloom of early womanhood. She lay
in the moonlight, her lips half parted, smiling
in her sleep, as if happy dreams were her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>54]</a></span>
guests. Her lustrous black hair, reaching
in heavy masses half way to her feet,
was her only covering. It was not shamelessness.
Neither was it the innocence
of a babe. It was Nature untainted
and unpurified by what we call civilization.</p>

<p>The sensations of the young man who had
never before seen a female face or form save
his mother&rsquo;s may be imagined more easily
than described. He stood gazing, like one
in a trance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">keike</i>,&rdquo; Hiwa observed with a peculiar
smile, as he reluctantly followed her,
&ldquo;at last you have seen a woman! And perhaps
it is time you should.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Avoiding the town, they made their way
to the Kukuihaele side of the valley, and
climbed to a height of about five hundred
feet. It seemed to Aelani, as the valley lay
spread before him, that he had already seen
it many times, it had been described to him
so well. To his right was the winding trail,
the serpentine ladder, that led to the heights
of Kukuihaele, forming the southern exit to
the outer world, and beyond, stretching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>55]</a></span>
northwesterly, long lines of white surf glistened
in the moonlight and thundered on
the beach. To his left was the mighty
southern wall, and, at its further end, the
stupendous falls of the Waipio River, sixteen
hundred feet high. Then the wall bent
irregularly to the northwest, apparently extending
to the Waimano side; but Aelani
knew that the valley, for a dozen miles more,
wound its way, a deep chasm in the mountains.
He knew the stream that traversed
it, joining the Waipio River near the sea.
He knew the rocky defile leading to the
southwest, by which an army might some
time enter to make him <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi</i>. He knew it
from vivid description, although he could
not see it. Opposite, across the valley, the
Waimano cliffs, which Hiwa sixteen years
before had sealed in her flight, rose to an
altitude of three thousand feet, and below
them, in the midst of rich, green lowlands,
lay the royal town. In the centre of the
town, distinguished by its size, was the palace
of the <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi</i>, and near it that of the high-priest.
Scattered through the valley, and
also distinguishable by their size and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>56]</a></span>
clusters of huts about them, were the town
residences of the great nobles. Kaanaana&rsquo;s
was on the Kukuihaele side, not far from
where Hiwa and Aelani stood. But it was
empty. He and his retinue had long since
withdrawn to his domains beyond the mountains
of Hamakua.</p>

<p>The night was calm, and, as Hiwa was
pointing out things to be carefully remembered,
and the houses of the different chiefs,
a wail arose which, spreading beyond the
town, reached them even where they stood.
It was the mournful <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">au-we</i>, passing from lip
to lip, at first low, gradually swelling to
loud, passionate shrieks, and then subsiding
to weird, blood-curdling sobs. A few started
it, then hundreds, then thousands took it up,
and the mountains echoed with it&mdash;&ldquo;<em lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Au-we!
Au-we! Au-we!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hiwa&rsquo;s face lighted with a smile of joy, at
once savage and sublime.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;is the wailing
for a dead <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi</i>! The drunkard has gone!
Our time has come!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stood for some minutes, rapidly forming
plans of action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>57]</a></span>
&ldquo;Follow the cliff to the beach,&rdquo; she said
at last, &ldquo;and wait for me at the mouth of
the river. It may be an hour. It may be
more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should go with you,&rdquo; urged Aelani.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Keike</i>,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;do as I bid you!
The Spirit of Hiwa must appear at the wailing
for the dead <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi</i> to make the hearts of
Aa and the hearts of his followers like the
white milk of cocoanuts, and the <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi</i> that
shall be must not be seen in his royal city
till he comes to it with the spearmen of
Kohala at his back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Aelani followed the cliff to the sea and
waited at the mouth of the river. But
Hiwa crept through the rank vegetation of
the rich <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">kuleanas</i> until she reached the river,
and swam softly up stream under the shade
of the overhanging bushes until she was
close to the palace of the <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi</i>, and there she
hid herself in a clump of trees, a point from
which she could see and hear what was taking
place.</p>

<p>She knew that, for the next three days,
according to ancient usage, there would be
no <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi</i>, and therefore no law. She knew the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>58]</a></span>
nameless horrors that accompanied the wailing
for a dead <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi</i>, the drunkenness, the
mutilations, the bestial excesses, the wild
carnival of cruelty, indecency, and lust, and
the wiping out of life-long grudges with fire
and bloodshed.</p>

<p>But the weak and friendless were nothing
to Aa. His followers were the beasts of
prey who would revel in outrage and murder.
Why should he restrain them? Yet Hiwa,
in amazement, saw him send twenty picked
men in the direction of the sea, and heard
him mention the name of Manoa. It could
hardly be to murder her. The time for
murder would be hours later, when men were
frenzied with drink. But, if it were to save
her from possibility of outrage, it was none
too soon.</p>

<p>Hiwa dismissed it from her thoughts for
the moment. Her first purpose was to fill
the minds of Aa and his followers with
superstitious terror. The great high-priest
was as fanatical as he was bloody, and believed
in the religion of which he was the
official head. He bent over the body of his
nephew, chanting:</p>

<div class="i0">Ue, ue! Ua make kuu alii!&rdquo;<br /></div>

<p>And the assembled chiefs took up the refrain:</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">&ldquo;Ue, ue! Ua make kuu alii!&rdquo;<br /></div>
</div>

</div>

<p>A voice, low and distinct, came from the
river-bank, saying:</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">&ldquo;Ue, ue! Ua make kuu alii!<br /></div>

<p>Ae! Dead is the chief! The Spirit of
Hiwa comes from the other world for the
Spirit of Ii, Ruler of Land and Sea. And,
lo! the Spirit of Hiwa prophesies, and her
word is the word of a goddess who sees the
things that have been and the things that
shall be. Aa, The Bloody, shall be a mouse
in the day of battle, and shall die a pig&rsquo;s
death, and his bones shall not be hidden in
a cave, but shall be put to open shame. And,
behold! there shall come a <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi</i>, The Chosen
of Gods. At his birth the rainbow covered
him, and Ku thundered from the mountains.
None shall be able to withstand him, for Ku
shall go before him, and behind him the hills
shall be black with spearmen.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>60]</a></span>
Aa&rsquo;s cruel face was sallow with rage and
terror, and blank amazement held the chiefs
spell-bound. At length one of them, bolder
or less superstitious than the rest, ventured
to the river-bank whence the voice had
come. The water flowed sluggishly and
undisturbed. Far down towards the sea
was a ripple that might have been made by
a fish.</p>

<p>Hiwa swam under water for fifty yards,
and then, having risen to breathe, took another
long swim beneath the surface. So
she kept on, alert and invisible. As she
neared the hut of Eaeakai, the fisherman,
and raised her head, she heard loud voices,
shrieks of terror, and a cry as of some one
in death agony. She crept up under cover
of the river-bank and looked. Aa&rsquo;s men
were dragging Lilii and Manoa away in the
direction of the town, and Eaeakai lay on the
ground with a spear-thrust through his body.</p>

<p>Beneath caste and religion, which put an
immeasurable gulf between them, Hiwa had
a woman&rsquo;s heart. Besides, she remembered
the fisherman had been the means of saving
her life. Then she was beginning to think
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>61]</a></span>
it possible that Lilii was her mother&rsquo;s as
well as her father&rsquo;s daughter, and, if so,
Manoa, being of the blood of the gods, was
a fit mate for Aelani. As soon, therefore, as
Aa&rsquo;s men were at a safe distance she went
to Eaeakai and bent over him. But the
moment he saw her he shrank from her in
fear, and, with his last remaining strength,
turned and buried his face in the dust.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not want to live,&rdquo; he moaned, &ldquo;for
they have taken the joy of my heart and the
life of my life. But why do you come&mdash;a
vision to me&mdash;oh, goddess? Leave me to
die alone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Hiwa spoke very gently to him, and
tears stood in her eyes. &ldquo;You shall die in
peace,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and your body shall be
buried in the ground as becomes your degree.
I cannot save your life, my poor fellow;
I would if I could. It may not be
given me to rescue those you love, but this
much I promise you, I will try.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goddess,&rdquo; murmured the dying man, &ldquo;I
thank you with my face in the dust.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One thing more!&rdquo; cried Hiwa, and her
voice grew stern, and her eyes flashed. &ldquo;I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>62]</a></span>
swear to you that Aa, who did this thing,
shall die a pig&rsquo;s death, and his bones shall
not be hidden in a cave, but shall be put to
open shame!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again the fisherman murmured his thanks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why did he take them?&rdquo; inquired
Hiwa, her suspicion becoming almost a conviction
that he had a deeper motive than the
mere possession of a young and beautiful
woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; replied Eaeakai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is your wife? Who was her mother?&rdquo;
Hiwa demanded, for she saw that the
man&rsquo;s life was fast ebbing away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; he feebly answered.
&ldquo;She was exposed and adopted, picked up,
a new-born babe, the very day the great
goddess who now speaks to me was born.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who found her? Who picked her up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eaeakai tried to answer, but the death
rattle was in his throat, a convulsive shudder
ran through his frame, and, with his face
still in the dust, he died.</p>

<p>Hiwa swam to the mouth of the river,
where she found Aelani waiting. In a few
words she told him what had happened,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>63]</a></span>
but not what the dying man had said.
She had never before seen him so deeply
moved. Although time pressed and a kingdom
was at stake, they returned and buried
the fisherman according to his degree, as had
been promised.</p>

<p>As they swam home in the small hours of
the morning, Hiwa pondered on many things,
not least on the mystery of the fisherman&rsquo;s
wife and daughter. She remembered that
Lolo, the court jester, once asked her if she
had seen her twin sister, and, when she
repeated the saying, that her mother laughed
and said it was only the quip of a fool;
but, never hearing of it again, she did not
believe it, although she knew the custom of
her people, and also that Lolo died that
night of a broken head.</p>

<p>More kittens are drowned than grow up,
yet there is no dearth of cats. Infanticide
was regarded in much the same way by the
ancient Hawaiians. No woman was thought
worse of on account of killing her babies,
and a large percentage of new-born children
were exposed to perish, or to be picked up
and adopted, as chance might direct. Hiwa
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>64]</a></span>
and Lilii, therefore, might be twin sisters,
and it might have been thought that twin
princesses, too divine to marry mortal men,
would cause state embarrassments. The
more Hiwa thought it over the more probable
it seemed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aa,&rdquo; she mused, &ldquo;is old and not fond of
women. He would not do this thing for the
girl&rsquo;s youth and beauty. Ambition is his
ruling passion, and now that Ii is dead it
blazes up in a fierce flame. If he knows, as
I believe, that they are my mother&rsquo;s child
and grandchild, he means to kill one to cut
off all possibility of rival heirs to the throne,
and to marry the other. That is why he
seized them the moment my brother was
dead. If the girl is Aelani&rsquo;s cousin on my
mother&rsquo;s side, the boy shall have her for
his wife in spite of Aa, for her blood is divine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Hiwa, pondering on these things, and
planning for the future, swam silently homeward.
Aelani swam in silence by her
side. A new inspiration had come to him.
The master passion of love had taken a
mighty hold on him. Heretofore he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>65]</a></span>
been a patient and painstaking pupil&mdash;not
because he greatly cared to be a <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi</i>, but because
he loved his mother. Now the pathway
to the throne was his only pathway to
Manoa.</p>

<h2><a name="chap09" id="chap09"></a>CHAPTER IX<br />

<span class="chaptitle">KAANAANA</span></h2>
</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/dcapw.png" width="200" height="200" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Hiwa returned from
Waipio, and had satisfied
the cravings of hunger, she
lay down and slept until the
shades of evening fell. She
slept fourteen hours, and
then arose and ate again, that she might
have strength for her journey. She put on
a <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">pau</i> of <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">tapa</i>, for it was not seemly for her
to go to the camp of a great chief unclothed.
Then she embraced Aelani and kissed him,
and taking a short spear to protect herself
from sharks, swam forth into the night.</p>

<p>She swam northwesterly, down the coast&mdash;that
is, with the prevailing winds&mdash;until she
came to Niulii, which is just beyond the
mountains of Hamakua and on the edge of
Kohala. It was only four or five miles; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>67]</a></span>
when she reached Niulii she knew not whether
her journey was nearly ended or only just
begun, for Kaanaana, not leaving the control
of his affairs to others, travelled much within
his domains. So she went to a hut and
wakened a fisherman, who told her that the
Lord of Kohala was camped not a mile away
with a hundred fighting men. The fisherman
readily undertook to guide her, for there
seemed good prospect of reward, and also
because her bearing proclaimed her a person
of high degree, and it was death to refuse a
service to man or woman of the rank of
high-chief.</p>

<p>When she drew near to the camp she dismissed
him, telling him to return on the
third day for a recompense. Then she
walked boldly up to a sentinel, who challenged her.
But when he saw her face, he
fell grovelling in the dust, and she said to
him, &ldquo;I am the Spirit of Hiwa. Thy master
hath need of me.&rdquo; So she passed on, and
the sentinel told it to others, and it spread
through the camp, and all wondered what
this great sign portended, for Ii&rsquo;s death was
not yet known in Kohala.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>68]</a></span>
When Hiwa came to the house where
Kaanaana slept alone, she found it guarded,
as of old, by Laamaikahiki. He also fell
grovelling in the dust, and crawled away at
her command. Then she entered the house
and lay down on Kaanaana&rsquo;s mat, and put
her arms around him and kissed his lips and
cried for joy. So she awoke him. At first
he thought it was a dream or a heavenly vision;
but when he found that she was indeed
Hiwa in living flesh and blood, his happiness
was unbounded, for he had mourned her as
dead sixteen years, and had loved no other
woman. And she lay in his arms all night,
and told him everything that had happened,
save only her sin against Ku and her vow.
She did not tell him of the sin lest he should
loathe her, or of the vow, for she knew it
would break his heart.</p>

<p>When morning came Kaanaana commanded
Laamaikahiki to wait on Hiwa, for, although
Laamaikahiki was no longer lord of
broad lands, he was of ancient and noble
blood, and was devoted to his chief, and had
the golden gift of a silent tongue; therefore
Kaanaana chose him before all others for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>69]</a></span>
the honor of serving the goddess-queen. But
Kaanaana, having ordered yellow stain, with
his own hands stained Hiwa&rsquo;s garment the
royal color. Having done this, he assembled
his vassals and fighting men, all that were
with him, and they stood, rank by rank, with
spears in their hands, in front of the house,
and their lord stood at their head.</p>

<p>Hiwa put on her garment, and went out
and stood before them. And Kaanaana fell
upon his knees, and bowed his head to the
ground, and kissed her feet. The lesser
chiefs, also, fell upon their knees, and bowed
their heads to the earth, and those of low
degree lay prostrate in the dust.</p>

<p>Then Hiwa said: &ldquo;I am Hiwa, <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Moi Wahine</i>,
daughter of Papaakahi, The Mighty,
Child of the Gods. When Aa, the wicked
high-priest, pursued me to kill me, Ukanipo,
the God of the Sharks, rescued me and carried
me to a cavern in the mountains known
only to himself. There I gave birth to a
son, who is also the son of Kaanaana, your
high-chief. The rainbow covered him at his
birth, and Ku thundered from the mountains.
His name is Aelani, The Pledge from Heaven,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>70]</a></span>
The Chosen of the Gods. He is now rightful
<i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi kane</i>, for Ii is dead. He shall be mightiest
of his line, and none shall be able to
withstand him, for, in the day of battle, Ku
shall go before him, and behind him the
hills shall be black with spearmen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Kaanaana answered: &ldquo;Hiwa, <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Moi
Wahine</i>, daughter of Papaakahi, The Mighty,
Child of the Gods, it is thou who hast said
it. No man can doubt that Ukanipo, the
God of Sharks, rescued thee, and carried thee
to a cavern in the mountains known only to
himself. Nor is it passing strange, for we
all do know from the ancient <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">meles</i>, which
have come to us from many generations of
wise men, that Ukanipo often did such things
in olden times. Ii being dead, thy son and
mine is <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi kane</i>. His word is as the word
of Ku. The spearmen of Kohala await his
commands.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="chap10" id="chap10"></a>CHAPTER X<br />

<span class="chaptitle">&ldquo;THE THUNDERBOLT IS SWIFTER THAN
THUNDER&rdquo;</span></h2>
</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/dcaph.png" width="203" height="200" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">HIWA wished to make the
secret entrance to the crater
known to Kaanaana, and
they both thought it should
not be disclosed to any one
else. So he accompanied
her on her return, the night after her arrival,
having first given orders that no one should
follow them under pain of death.</p>

<p>They found Aelani awake. &ldquo;<i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Keike</i>,&rdquo; said
Hiwa, &ldquo;this is your father. His spearmen
await your commands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Kaanaana kneeled before his son and
kissed his feet. But Aelani raised him from
the ground and put his arms about him and
kissed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I love you because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>72]</a></span>
my mother loves you better than her own
life, and has talked to me about you every
day since I was a little child. While the
homage due the <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi</i> cannot be omitted in
public, between us three I am not a god
among men, but only your son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Kaanaana embraced Aelani, and the
two ate together, Hiwa sitting not far off,
for it was contrary to the commands of Ku
for men and women to eat together. After
the <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi</i> and his father had eaten by themselves,
and Hiwa had eaten by herself, Aelani
slept in the grass hut, and Hiwa and Kaanaana
slept under the great <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">koa</i> tree, for the
moon had gone behind the mountains, and it
was not safe to attempt taking the fisherman&rsquo;s
boat through the passage in pitchy darkness.</p>

<p>It was easy, however, in daylight, for
there were three of them and a calm sea.
So they set forth early in the morning and
went to Niulii. But there were fishermen
from Waipio fishing opposite the cliff who
fled home in terror, and reported that they
had seen the Spirit of Hiwa issuing from the
depths of the sea, and with her the Lord of
Kohala and a young man whom they knew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>73]</a></span>
not, and that the three had a boat provided
by the God of the Ocean, exceeding light
and swift, in which they sped down the
coast. The tale was taken straightway to
Aa, and it greatly troubled him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile rumors had gone forth through
all of Kohala round about Niulii, and, when
Aelani arrived, wearing the royal <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">mamo</i>,
thousands of people had assembled to do
him homage. They were cooking a great
feast for him in an <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">umu</i> or underground
oven of hot stones&mdash;fatted dog and pig
which he had never tasted, and <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">taro</i> and
bread-fruit, and many kinds of <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">lawalu</i> fish.
Also they had prepared many kinds of delicate
raw fish, flavored with <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">kukui</i> nuts,
and crabs and shrimps and mosses. There
were also fruits and berries, both from the
lowlands and from the mountains. Neither
was there any lack of <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">awa</i> that all might
drink and be merry.</p>

<p>But Aelani, as soon as he had received
the homage of the people, called a council of
war, for time was precious, and the thought
that Manoa was in the power of his enemy
was like a hot coal in his breast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>74]</a></span>
It was only a dozen miles from Niulii to
Waipio by water; but Kaanaana had not
war canoes wherewith to fight Aa on the
sea, neither had he canoes of any kind to
carry a sufficient force of fighting men.
Therefore, an attack on the coast side would
have been madness; but the Saw-Teeth were
impassable, and the trail around them was
long and difficult.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord of Kohala,&rdquo; inquired Aelani,
&ldquo;how many spearmen can you have at daylight
to-morrow morning, with provisions to
cross the mountains?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not more than eight hundred,&rdquo; replied
Kaanaana. &ldquo;But I will have five thousand
on the fourth day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eight hundred to-morrow,&rdquo; said Aelani,
&ldquo;are better than five thousand on the fourth
day. If Aa depends on Kaaahu, Lord of
Honokaa, he leans on a fern that will sway
back and forth as the wind blows. Yet the
<i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">ahupuaa</i> of Honokaa is the nearest of the
great lordships, and the only one from which
Aa can muster many spears before the fourth
day. We should strike before any of the
great chiefs can come to his help from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>75]</a></span>
south, for we are few at best, and only a
small part of the kingdom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kaanaana fell upon his knees and bowed
his head to the ground. &ldquo;Child of the
gods,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;shall I speak my <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">manao</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rise and speak!&rdquo; exclaimed Aelani.
&ldquo;Thou art the greatest and wisest of my
nobles. Thy <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi</i> will ever listen to thy
<i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">manao</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">manao</i> is that the great chiefs will
not hasten from the south. They do not
love Aa, and will stand aloof if they dare, or
side with us if we seem the stronger. Moreover,
Aa has twelve hundred fighting men at
Waipio, and Kaaahu can bring him a thousand
more before we can get there. Our
way is over steep and difficult mountains,
among sharp rocks and utter desolation,
where mice would die of hunger and thirst,
and even lizards cannot live. Our spearmen,
exhausted with the journey, must fight men
strong with rest and sleep. If we start to-morrow,
we shall also be greatly outnumbered,
and if we lose the battle not one of us
will ever return. If we wait till the fourth
day, and only one or two chiefs come against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>76]</a></span>
us from the south, we can meet Aa with
equal numbers. Yet it shall be as the <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi
kane</i> says. His word is as the word of Ku.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kaanaana, Lord of Kohala,&rdquo; said Aelani,
&ldquo;I thank thee for honest counsel, and I
would also have the lesser chiefs freely
speak their <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">manao</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thereupon the lesser chiefs fell upon their
knees and bowed their heads to the earth,
and the foremost of them spoke for all and
said: &ldquo;The way is most difficult, and eight
hundred spearmen are not many, yet what
the Child of the Gods says that we will do,
whether it be life or death. His word is as
the word of Ku.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Hiwa spoke, as was her right in the
royal councils, being equal in birth and rank
to the <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi kane</i> himself, although not in
power. And she said: &ldquo;The Lord of Kohala
is the wisest and greatest of the nobles.
He and the lesser chiefs have spoken well;
but fear now dwells in the heart of Aa and
in the hearts of his followers. My <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">manao</i>
is to strike before it passeth away, that the
hearts of the chiefs in the south may also
become like white wax of cocoanuts, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>77]</a></span>
that they may turn from him in the beginning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As Hiwa hath said, so be it!&rdquo; exclaimed
Aelani. &ldquo;We march to-morrow at break of
day. The thunderbolt is swifter than the
thunder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instantly fast runners were sent forth to
summon the spearmen and get supplies of
food. Then Aelani ate and drank, and the
chiefs were merry, but Aelani&rsquo;s merriment
was feigned, for he greatly feared for
Manoa&rsquo;s safety, and was impatient for battle
because she was in the power of his enemy.</p>

<span class="chaptitle">OVER THE MOUNTAINS</span></h2>
</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/dcape.png" width="204" height="200" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">EIGHT hundred and nineteen
men, armed and provisioned,
were on hand at daybreak
the next morning.
Aelani made a stirring
speech, telling them that Ii
was dead, and that Aa was preparing to invade
Kohala to slaughter all the men and
give their wives and <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">kuleanas</i> to strangers.
And Kaanaana told them of their new <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi</i>,
rainbow-covered and heaven-born.</p>

<p>The spearmen raised a great shout and
cried: &ldquo;His word is as the word of Ku, and
we will follow Kaanaana, our high-chief,
where spears are thickest, even unto death!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hiwa accompanied them. When Kaanaana
privately remonstrated, she replied:
&ldquo;Hardships and hunger and thirst are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>79]</a></span>
heaven with you, my lover, and so are
wounds and death; but without you, all the
world is hell to me. What mortal man can
do and suffer, that surely can I, daughter of
the gods. Moreover, if the chiefs do not
see me, whom they know, they will say
that Aelani, whom they do not know, is
but an impostor. My love, I must go with
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So she went to the war, and was ever by
Kaanaana&rsquo;s side, save at meals, which their
religion forbade. Although Ii was now
dead, Kaanaana did not seek to be Hiwa&rsquo;s
husband, for he loved her too unselfishly to
wish her to demean herself, being goddess-born,
by marriage to a mortal. And she did
not propose marriage to him, which would
have been her place by custom, she being the
higher of rank, because she would not involve
him in the wrath of Ku. She counted the
coming days of suffering and battle as precious&mdash;every
moment, because they were
spent with him, for she knew that as soon as
they were over she must leave him and die
on the altar of Ku.</p>

<p>Aelani marched with elastic steps at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>80]</a></span>
the head of his little army. He ate plain
fish and <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">poi</i> like the meanest soldier, drank
tepid but precious water as sparingly, and
bore the withering midday heat of the lava-flows
and the cold night winds of the mountains
as if they were the eternal June of the
lowlands. So also did Hiwa and Kaanaana,
knowing that where leaders share all hardships
cheerfully their followers do not lose
heart.</p>

<p>On the evening of the second day they
had crossed the mountains, and were within
half a dozen miles of Waipio. They could
not take the enemy entirely unawares, for
those fleeing before them had carried the
news. Nor were they in a condition to fight
that night, for they were utterly exhausted.
Nearly fifty had dropped of fatigue by the
way, and three, falling over a precipice, had
been dashed to pieces on the rocks a thousand
feet below. The little army camped in a
wood hard by and slept till morning.</p>

<p>Hiwa slept two hours. Then she awoke
Kaanaana with a kiss and said: &ldquo;I have
wakened you, my love, that you might not
awake later and miss me from your side. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>81]</a></span>
am going to the enemy. Our scouts, as you
know, report the gleam of spears on the
heights of Kukuihaele. It is Kaaahu and
his thousand men come to the help of Aa.
Our men are outnumbered three to one, and
so worn out they can hardly stand. Some
of them are dying of fatigue, and some have
already died.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you, my love,&rdquo; interrupted Kaanaana,
&ldquo;will also die unless you sleep this
night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Hiwa, &ldquo;I shall not die of
fatigue, nor yet of spear-thrust from mortal
man. I shall live until our son is unquestioned
<i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi</i>. A goddess gave me life, and
only through a god shall it be taken from
me. My fate is unalterable. It is in the
hands of Ku. <em lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Pau!</em> My love, you know
that your spearmen, exhausted as they are,
cannot fight two thousand men. They will
be slaughtered like swine in to-morrow&rsquo;s
battle, and our cause will be lost unless I put
fresh fear in the hearts of the enemy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kaanaana made no further objection,
knowing that her words were true, and
that, unless she succeeded in her mission,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>82]</a></span>
they must all die together. When she had
gone, although his heart was heavy on her
account, he turned over and slept soundly
that he might have strength for the morrow&rsquo;s
battle. So Hiwa went forth and descended
the heights to the Waipio River, which,
even at that distance from the sea, was then
deep enough for swimming. The water and
the change of motion greatly refreshed her
bruised and bleeding feet and aching limbs.
She passed the hostile sentinels, swimming
noiselessly under water, and kept on down
the river to the midst of Aa&rsquo;s army.</p>

<p>Then Aa&rsquo;s spearmen, sleeping on their
arms, were awakened by a well-known voice
proceeding from the water, and it said:&mdash;&ldquo;Listen!
The Spirit of Hiwa bids you save
your lives. Why should you die? Behold,
the rightful <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi kane</i>, <em lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Aelani</em>, The Pledge
from Heaven, The Chosen of the Gods, cometh
to his own! Ku thundered at his birth, and
the rainbow covered him; therefore none
shall be able to stand before him. Yet he
is just and merciful. He will slay those who
are taken with arms in their hands, fighting
against him. He will spare those who stand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>83]</a></span>
aloof. But Aa shall die a pig&rsquo;s death, and
his bones shall be put to shame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Hiwa swam down-stream under
water so softly that not a splash was heard
or a ripple seen, and an hour past midnight
the same voice and words were heard on the
heights of Kukuihaele.</p>

<p>At dawn Kaanaana awoke and looked
upon Hiwa sleeping at his side. She was
covered with blood, and great, ragged rents
were torn in her flesh, for she had slipped
and fallen while descending from the heights
of Kukuihaele in the darkness of the night.
Her eyes were sunken, her face was gaunt
with toil and pain, and she slept like one
dead. Kaanaana forbade all noise in that
part of the camp, and made it silent as the
grave, so that Hiwa might sleep until the
men were ready to go forth to battle. Then
he awoke her gently, and she arose and took
her place beside him at the head of the
warriors, armed as a warrior, and so she
marched to the fight.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">AA was brave as well as cruel.
He did not doubt that
Hiwa&rsquo;s spirit had appeared
in his camp and on the
heights of Kukuihaele; but,
although it troubled him
greatly, he hoped it was a lying spirit. Did
not the whole nation know that the <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi
wahine</i> had committed the unpardonable
sin and had died from Ku&rsquo;s implacable wrath,
which descends from parent to child even unto
the third and fourth generation? How, then,
could her claimant to the throne enjoy Ku&rsquo;s
favor? And how could he be of the sacred
race which the gods had sent from heaven
to rule men? Yet Hiwa&rsquo;s spirit had thrice
proclaimed him as heaven-born, The Chosen
of Ku, and living witnesses had seen him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>85]</a></span>
and Hiwa and Kaanaana issue from the
depths of the sea, where mortals unaided by
the gods would have perished. Superstition
balanced superstition. Men were afraid to
support Aelani, and afraid to fight against
him, lest the heavy wrath of Ku should fall
upon them.</p>

<p>It was not so with the spearmen of Kohala.
Kaanaana had always believed that Aa invented
the story of Hiwa&rsquo;s sin as a pretext
for hunting her to death, and what the high-chief
believed was accepted in his own domains
without question. Had it not proved
true? Was she not now with them in living
flesh and blood? Was not the story of her
rescue by Ukanipo, God of Sharks, reasonable
and in accord with the sacred <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">meles</i> that
had come down from the wise men of old?
Most convincing of all, would Ku have permitted
her to live if she had committed damning
sin?</p>

<p>Before the spearmen of Kohala arrived, Aa
succeeded in persuading most of his immediate
followers, and also himself, that Hiwa
was a lying spirit. He even won over Kaaahu,
Lord of Honokaa, who was swaying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>86]</a></span>
between opposing opinions like a fern in the
wind, and set him and his men in the front
of battle, where they could not easily run
away.</p>

<p>The old men, the women, and the children
had collected in the <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">puuhonua</i>. This was a city
of refuge corresponding to those of ancient
Israel. These sanctuaries, some of them very
large and with accommodations for many people,
were scattered throughout the Hawaiian
Islands. Their gates stood always open, and
the vanquished warrior, the rebel, the red-handed
murderer, the violator of <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">tabus</i>, the
vilest criminal, or the bitterest enemy of the
<i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi</i> or of the priesthood, was safe when once
within their sacred walls. There he offered
thanks to the gods for his escape, and, after
a few days, was free to depart under their
protection. It is said that, in the latter part
of the fifteenth century, long after the period
of this story, Hakau, The Cruel, proposed
to slaughter the followers of his half-brother,
Umi, within the sanctuary, and was deterred
by the threatening vengeance of the gods&mdash;incidentally,
also, by his own death, and the
complete triumph of Umi. Where did these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>87]</a></span>
people, so remote and isolated, get this and
so many other of the customs described in
the Jewish scriptures?</p>

<p>It was past noon when the conflict began&mdash;less
than eight hundred tired men attacking
twenty-two hundred fresh ones. But as
the spearmen of Kohala advanced, amazement
paralyzed the ranks opposing them.
The <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi wahine</i>, or her spirit, marched in
front, and beside her strode a youth, wearing
the royal <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">mamo</i>, who was the living
image of Papaakahi, The Mighty, in his
younger days, but of more gigantic stature,
and handsomer, and more regal in his bearing,
than even that great conqueror.</p>

<p>Kaaahu and his men, crying that the dead
had come to life, and that Aelani must be
The Chosen of the Gods, broke and fled
without throwing a spear. They made their
way with no great loss to the heights of
Kukuihaele, and watched the battle in safety.
But, in the confusion, Aa and his spearmen
were forced back, and were hedged in
with the cliffs of Kukuihaele at their left,
and the river at their right, and the sea behind
them. They could not run away, and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>88]</a></span>
as they expected no quarter, they fought
with desperation. The odds, too, seemed
greatly in their favor, for they were picked
warriors, many of them nobles, and were
fresh, and far outnumbered their assailants.</p>

<p>But doubt and superstitious fear were with
them, while the spearmen of Kohala were
confident of victory, and forgot their weariness
in the blood-frenzy of battle. Their
<i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi kane</i> was at their head, and beside him
the <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi wahine</i>, and Kaanaana, their high-chief,
the foremost warrior in the land. So,
although they fell thick and fast before Aa&rsquo;s
skilled spearmen, they pressed on and slew
and slew and slew. The <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi kane</i> and the
<i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi wahine</i> and the Lord of Kohala, excelling
all others in deeds of strength, and skill
and valor, were ever in advance, their spears,
dripping with blood, yet they received no
hurt so that men said that Ku went before
them. They continually strove to reach Aa
and kill him, for his death would end the
war; but his spearmen, knowing the rout and
slaughter that would follow, protected him
with dense ranks of spears.</p>

<p>Then Aelani did a marvellous thing, one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>89]</a></span>
that was told in after ages, which no man
could have done without long and patient
training. He hurled a spear over the heads
of Aa&rsquo;s men, fully seventy yards, so that it
struck Aa below the waist and passed
through his body. Aa fell, and his warriors,
supposing that he was dead, became panic-stricken,
and, being hemmed in by the cliffs
and the sea and the river, were slaughtered
without mercy.</p>

<p>Just as the fighting changed into a butchery,
Aelani plunged into the river and swam
across, and ran with all his speed towards
Aa&rsquo;s palace. He had heard a shriek, and,
looking that way, saw Manoa rush from the
palace in the direction of his army, pursued
by three men armed with spears. So he
hastened to her rescue. As he drew near to
the men, they flung their spears at him at
the same moment. He evaded one of the
spears, and caught the other two in his hands
as he had been taught to do in his childhood.
Then he flung the two spears back, killing
two of the men with them, and the third he
killed with a stone. Thus he saved Manoa&rsquo;s
life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>90]</a></span>
The thing was the wickedness of Aa, for,
knowing that Lilii and Manoa were of the
divine blood of Wakea and Papa in the female
line, he had commanded that they
should be killed if the battle went against
him, so that the victor might have no goddess-born
wife. He had assigned the murder
to the three men he trusted most, and they
killed the mother before the daughter escaped.</p>

<p>The slaughter ended when darkness came.
A few of Aa&rsquo;s men scaled the heights of
Kukuihaele; a few swam out to sea and got
away; a few score swam across the river
and reached the <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">puuhonua</i> and were safe,
but many more were speared in attempting
it. The greater part perished. A fourth of
Kaanaana&rsquo;s men perished also. In all more
than a thousand men lay dead and dying on
the field. The victorious survivors, worn out
with marching and slaughter, sank on the
ground beside them and slept until morning.</p>

<p>Hiwa and Kaanaana slept from dark till
dawn; but the young <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi kane</i>, who had
that day won his kingdom, lay awake many
hours, and when sleep came to him he
dreamed of love, and not of glory.</p>



<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap13" id="chap13"></a>CHAPTER XIII<br />

<span class="chaptitle">THE SACRIFICE</span></h2>
</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/dcapi.png" width="202" height="200" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN the morning after the battle
word was brought to the
palace that Aa had been
found on the field still alive.
Aelani commanded that he
should be taken to the <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">heiau</i>,
or temple, to be sacrificed, and that the spearmen
should be assembled there to witness
the sacred rites. So Aa was taken to the
<i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">heiau</i>, and awaited the coming of Aelani and
Hiwa and Kaanaana and the spearmen of
Kohala.</p>

<p>Then Aelani&rsquo;s servants put on him the
great <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">mamo</i> that had been the state robe of
<i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi kanes</i> of the blood of Wakea and Papa
time whereof the memory of man ran not to
the contrary. It reached from his shoulders
to his ankles, and enveloped his whole body.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>92]</a></span>
It was made entirely of the yellow feathers
of the <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">mamo</i>, and, as the <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">mamo</i> was a small
bird, and lived in the mountains, and was
wild and scarce, from being constantly hunted,
and, moreover, had but few of the sacred
feathers, the collection of feathers for that
cloak had been the life-work of nine generations
of hunters. Aelani also wore a helmet
of the still more priceless feathers of the <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">oo</i>.
The <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">niho palaoa</i> was on his neck, and in
his hand he carried spears red with the blood
of his enemies.</p>

<p>Hiwa wore a <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">mamo</i> like Aelani&rsquo;s, broad
and long, extending to her feet, priceless as
the crown jewels of England. Upon her
head was a <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">lei</i>, or wreath of yellow <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">ilima</i> and
dark-green <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">maile</i>, and, crowning all, a <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">lei</i> of
the fluffy, yellow feathers of the <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">oo</i>, feathers
worth many times their weight in gold.
Kaanaana, too, was richly clad, as became a
mighty high-chief. A cloak of yellow and
red feathers, only less rare and costly than
the <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">mamo</i>, covered him from head to foot,
and a yellow and red helmet adorned his
head.</p>

<p>Before they left the palace Hiwa embraced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>93]</a></span>
Aelani and Kaanaana, kissing them and
shedding tears, as if she were parting from
them forever, so that they greatly wondered,
not dreaming of what was in her mind. Then,
when the chiefs had assembled&mdash;all who had
the right to stand in presence of the <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi</i>&mdash;Hiwa
made a signal that Kaanaana should
kneel before her. So he kneeled before her,
and she, in presence of them all, took the
feather <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">lei</i> from her head and twined it
around his helmet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mighty <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">konohiki</i>,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;thou art
greatest of the chiefs, noblest among men,
my own and only love, the father of my
child. Thy rank shall be above all other
men not goddess-born, and, in token thereof,
thou and the <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">konohikis</i> of thy line shall have
the right to deck their helmets with the
yellow feathers of the <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">oo</i> as long as the sun
shines and water flows. I, Hiwa, daughter
of the gods, have said it, and my son, The
Chosen of Ku, confirms this royal honor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The occasion of the sacrifice was a great
one, for Aa was of the blood of Wakea and
Papa. Never before in the solemn and
bloody rites of consecrating a new <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi</i> had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>94]</a></span>
such an offering been made to Ku. The
<i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">heiau</i> was an immense, irregular, stone
parallelogram, open to the sky. The interior
was divided into terraces, the upper
one paved with flat stones. The south end
was an inner court, the most sacred place,
corresponding to the Holiest of Holies of
the Jews. Here were the idols, great and
small. Here was the high-priest&rsquo;s station.
Here the gods were consulted, and their
oracles made known. At the entrance to
this court was the sacrificial altar of Ku.</p>

<p>When Aelani and Hiwa and Kaanaana
and the chiefs and warriors had gathered in
the temple, and Aa, grievously wounded, was
brought before the altar where he had long
officiated as high-priest, his proud and cruel
spirit flashed forth, and he said:&mdash;&ldquo;If I had
won the battle I would have gone to Kohala
and put every man, woman and child to the
spear, save Aelani and Hiwa and Kaanaana
and all of noble birth, whom I would have
kept for the sacrifice; I would have made
Kohala fat with slaughter; I would have
drenched Ku&rsquo;s altar with the blood of the
goddess-born. Then Ku would have had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>95]</a></span>
more cause for rejoicing than in the sacrifice
of one old man. Yet, although my bones
will be put to shame, I am content, knowing
that Ku&rsquo;s heavy wrath will fall upon my
enemies, and that I shall glory in their destruction,
and mock them in the other world.
If Hiwa had been slain when she committed
the unpardonable sin against Ku his anger
might have been appeased; but now that it
has been growing these sixteen years, the
whole people are doomed, for they are her
people and her son&rsquo;s. Behold I, Aa, high-priest
of Ku, proclaim that his implacable
wrath rests upon the whole kingdom, and
shall eat up its inhabitants. My revenge is
sure. Therefore I rejoice, and shall return
rejoicing to the gods from whom I came!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the high-priest ceased speaking Kaanaana
sprang towards him, crying &ldquo;Aa, you
lie! You invented this damning lie as a
pretext for slaying the <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi wahine</i>! Now,
in the hour of her triumph, you repeat it to
ruin her before gods and men!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hiwa restrained him with a gesture, and
said in a loud, clear voice that all might
hear: &ldquo;Aa does not lie. Sixteen years ago
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>96]</a></span>
I forgot the law which almighty Ku gave to
Wakea and Papa&mdash;the law creating the
sacred <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">tabu</i>, which our nation has kept age
after age, and I ate of the fruit of which Ku
has declared, &lsquo;In the day a woman eateth
thereof she shall surely die.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon hearing this confession, the high-priest
burst into a fierce, mocking laugh,
and the spearmen shrank back aghast, and
Kaanaana hung his head in shame and sorrow.</p>

<p>But Hiwa mounted the altar and stood
above them, tall, straight and proud, crowned
with <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">ilima</i> and <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">maile</i>, clothed with the royal
robe that only a <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">moi</i> might wear and live,
holding a spear in her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sixteen years ago,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I committed
the unpardonable sin, and now the
hour of my atonement has come. Ku spared
my life. Kneeling under the rainbow, beside
my new-born babe, I confessed my sin
to him, and bound myself by an irrevocable
vow that, if he would let me train the boy
to lead the chiefs in battle for his throne, I,
Hiwa, goddess-queen, with my own royal
hand, would shed my sacred blood upon his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>97]</a></span>
altar. Ku heard the vow, and answered me
with thunder from the mountains. He has
kept faith with me. Now I must keep faith
with him, or else his heavy wrath will fall
on all I love, on all who follow me. Therefore,
to save my son, Aelani, The Pledge from
Heaven, to save his father, my lover, Kaanaana,
who is a thousand times dearer to me
than life, to save my people, whom I would
not have destroyed, I keep my oath and lift
the curse of Ku.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a swift stroke she buried the spear
in her own heart.</p>

<p>Kaanaana leaped upon the altar, crying:
&ldquo;Eternal Ku, although I am not goddess-born,
I am a great noble. Accept my life
also in atonement for her sin!&rdquo; He stabbed
himself, and, falling on Hiwa, died kissing
her dead lips.</p>

<p>Then Laamaikahiki, wild with grief and
rage, thrust Aa through the throat. So the
high-priest died a pig&rsquo;s death, and his bones
were put to shame.</p>

<p>Hiwa&rsquo;s bones and Kaanaana&rsquo;s were hidden
in a cave, at dead of night, by Aelani
himself, for he would not intrust this pious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>98]</a></span>
duty to meaner hands, that touch of mortal
might not profane them so long as the world
should endure. Hiwa had made such atonement,
lifting Ku&rsquo;s curse from all the people,
that they revered her memory and worshipped
her as a goddess even as if she had
not committed that great sin.</p>

<p><i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Aloha</i>, Hiwa! She was nobler than a
goddess-queen, for she was one of God&rsquo;s
noblest creatures&mdash;a noble woman. Her
frailties were those of human nature and of
the remote and barbarous land in which she
lived. Her virtues were those of a brave,
generous, and lovable people.</p>

<p><i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Aloha</i>, Hiwa! <em lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Aloha, nui!</em></p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>99]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="glossary" id="glossary"></a>GLOSSARY</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> spelling of Hawaiian words is in the main
phonetic, according to what is known as the continental
method, with the limitation that there are
only twelve letters, instead of twenty-six, in the
alphabet. Hiwa, for example, is pronounced,
approximately, H&eacute;-v&auml;, and Aelani, I-l&auml;&acute;-ny.</p>

<p>The following rules for pronunciation are taken
from Prof. William D. Alexander&rsquo;s <i>Brief History
of the Hawaiian People</i>:</p>

<p>The original Hawaiian alphabet, adopted by the
first missionaries, contained but twelve letters, five
of which were vowels, and seven consonants, viz.:
<i>a</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>u</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>l</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>p</i>, and <i>w</i>. The number of
distinct sounds are about sixteen.</p>

<p>No distinction was formerly made between the
sounds of <i>k</i> and <i>t</i>, or between those of <i>l</i> and <i>r</i>. In
poetry, however, the sound of <i>t</i> was preferred to
that of <i>k</i>. The letter <i>w</i> generally sounds like <i>v</i>
between the penult and the final syllable of a word.</p>

<p><i>A</i> is sounded as in f<i>a</i>ther, <i>e</i> as in th<i>e</i>y, <i>i</i> as in
mar<i>i</i>ne, <i>o</i> as in n<i>o</i>te, <i>u</i> as in r<i>u</i>le, or as <i>oo</i> in
m<i>oo</i>n.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>100]</a></span>
<i>Ai</i>, when sounded as a diphthong, resembles the
English <i>ay</i>, and <i>au</i>, the English <i>ou</i> in l<i>ou</i>d.</p>

<p>Besides the sounds mentioned above, there is in
many words a guttural break between two vowels,
which is represented by an apostrophe in a few common
words, to distinguish their meaning, as Kina&rsquo;u.</p>

<p>Every word and every syllable must end in a
vowel, and no two consonants occur without a
vowel sound between them.</p>

<p>The accent of about five-sixths of the words in
the language is on the penult. A few of the
proper names are accented on the final syllable, as
Paki&acute;, Kiwalao&acute; and Namakeha&acute;.</p>

<p><span class="smcap" lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Aa</span>&mdash;the word has a variety of meanings, among
which are a spiteful person, a raging flame, a rock
of rough broken lava.</p>

<p><span class="smcap" lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Ae, keike</span>&mdash;yes, child.</p>

<p><span class="smcap" lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Aelani</span>&mdash;the pledge from heaven, a promise
from the skies. Lani, heavenly, heaven-born, is
a common termination of the names of Hawaiian
men and women, especially those of exalted rank.</p>

<p><span class="smcap" lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Ahupuaa</span>&mdash;a large tract of land under the control
of a single person, a lordship.</p>

<p><span class="smcap" lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Aialo</span>&mdash;those who eat at the king&rsquo;s court.</p>

<p><span class="smcap" lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Akela</span>&mdash;a berry much like the American raspberry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap" lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Alii-niaupio, tabu moi wahine</span>&mdash;freely translated,
goddess-queen, a female sovereign of divine
or semi-divine lineage, unapproachable, sacred, absolute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>101]</a></span>
<span class="smcap" lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Aloha</span>&mdash;Aloha, more appropriately, perhaps,
than any other one word, may be taken as typical
of the Hawaiian race. It is the first native word
the stranger learns, the common salutation on the
street, and the last he hears at parting. It signifies
kindly feeling, good-will. It is also used to
express love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap" lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Aloha nui</span>&mdash;great good-will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap" lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Au-we</span>&mdash;an exclamation of sorrow, a wailing
cry, alas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap" lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Awa</span>&mdash;an intoxicating liquor made from the
roots of a plant of the same name. It is very
stupefying, and, when drunk to excess, causes the
skin to turn a dirty-brown color, and to crack and
